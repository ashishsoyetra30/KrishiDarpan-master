<h1>INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT</h1>
<h2>What is Integrated Weed Management:</h2>
<p>Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is an approach to managing weeds using multiple control tactics. The purpose of IWM is to include many methods in a growing season to allow producers the best chance to control troublesome weeds.</p>

<li><span id="s1"><info>Why Is IWM necessary:</info></span><br>
<span id="s2">It might be better to first discuss why weed control is necessary. Weeds negatively impact crop yields, interfere with many crop production practices, and weed seeds can contaminate grain. Based on national research, corn and soybean yield can be reduced by approximately 50% without effective weed control.<br>

Herbicide application is the main weed control strategy used. Reliance on this one method has led to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds. There are a limited number of herbicides available to use and cases of herbicide resistance are rapidly increasing in the US. As a result, herbicides are in need of extra help to continue to ensure adequate weed control.	</span></li><br>

<li><span id="s1"><info>Components of IWM:</info></span><br>
<span id="s2">The goal of IWM is to incorporate different methods of weed management into a combined effort to control weeds. Just as using the same herbicide again and again can lead to resistance, reliance on any one of the methods below over time can reduce its efficacy against weeds. Two major factors to consider when developing an IWM plan are (1) target weed species and (2) time, resources, and capabilities necessary to implement these tactics.<br>

While it is wise to be a good steward of herbicide technology, through the use of PRE and POST herbicide applications or tank mixes, IWM requires the use of tactics beyond herbicides. For example, using these herbicide application practices along with a winter cover crop or harvest weed seed control (HWSC) and prevention methods would be considered IWM.</span></li><br>
